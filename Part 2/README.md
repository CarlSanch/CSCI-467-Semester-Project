The second interface to the system runs in-house at company headquarters: finalized quotes can be retrieved, line items added, edited or removed, and prices can be changed. A discount can be given either as percentage or amount. All line items and the discount are computed into the final price quoted. The secret notes added by the sales associate can be reviewed, and new ones added. The quotes are updated in the quote database: either left unresolved, or sanctioned. Sanctioned quotes are considered complete and sent out via e-mail to the customer. The email contains all quote data except the secret notes.

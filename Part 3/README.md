The third interface (also in-house) allows to convert a quote into a purchase order once the customer has indicated to go ahead with the order (the go ahead is given outside of the scope of this system, e.g. via phone or snail mail). At this time an additional final discount can be entered. The final amount is computed. The purchase order is then sent to an external processing system (details provided later) which answers with a processing date and sales commission rate for the sales associate. The commission is computed and recorded for the quote and in the sales associateâ€™s accumulated commission. An email is sent to the customer with all the purchase details, including the processing date.
